## 🏷️ VERSION HISTORY

### v1.1.0 - 2025-07-19 (CHAT API FIX)
**Status**: ✅ WORKING  
**Branch**: `claude-cursor-integration`

#### 🐛 BUGS FIXED
- **CRITICAL**: "Failed to check run status" error blocking all chat functionality
  - **Root Cause**: OpenAI SDK `runs.retrieve()` parameter format issue
  - **Solution**: Bypassed run status checking entirely, poll messages directly
  - **Files Changed**: `app/api/chat/route.tsx`
  - **Time Lost**: 12 hours of debugging circles
  - **Lesson**: 30-minute rule for external API parameter errors

#### ✨ NEW FEATURES
- Created `/api/quick-demo` endpoint for instant working demos
- Added comprehensive `/api/debug` endpoint for system diagnostics
- Implemented `DEBUGGING_GUIDE.md` with 30-minute rule

#### 🔧 IMPROVEMENTS
- Chat API now more reliable (no run status dependency)
- Better error messages throughout API endpoints
- Domain detection working correctly for Vercel previews

#### 🚨 KNOWN ISSUES
- Vercel Preview Deployment Protection causes 401s (workaround documented)
- Font preload warnings (cosmetic, not breaking)

#### 📊 WHAT'S WORKING
- ✅ Chat functionality end-to-end
- ✅ OpenAI thread creation and persistence
- ✅ Redis assistant mapping
- ✅ Domain detection for preview URLs
- ✅ n8n workflow integration
- ✅ Demo creation pipeline

#### ⚠️ WHAT'S NOT WORKING
- Nothing critical (all core functionality operational)

---

### v1.0.0 - 2025-07-18 (INITIAL SETUP)
**Status**: 🔶 PARTIALLY WORKING  
**Branch**: `main`

#### ✨ INITIAL FEATURES
- Next.js app with OpenAI Assistants API
- Redis integration for assistant mapping
- n8n workflow for demo creation
- Company-specific demo pages (`/[company]`)

#### 🐛 INITIAL ISSUES
- Hardcoded domain issues
- Chat API threading problems
- Deployment authentication blocks

## 🧠 LESSONS LEARNED

### 🎯 DEBUGGING PATTERNS THAT WORK
1. **30-minute rule** for external API issues → find alternative approach
2. **Debug endpoints first** → isolate components before full system testing
3. **Trust console errors** → they show exact failure points
4. **Direct API calls** > SDK abstractions when typing issues exist

### 🚫 ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID
1. Fixing multiple things simultaneously
2. Fighting external API changes instead of routing around them
3. Complex utility functions that hide real errors
4. Testing full flow before individual components

### 🔧 TECHNICAL DECISIONS
| Decision | Reason | Alternative Considered | Result |
|----------|--------|----------------------|--------|
| Skip run status checking | SDK typing issues | Fix SDK parameters | ✅ Works perfectly |
| Direct message polling | More reliable | Stream responses | ✅ Simpler, stable |
| Bypass Vercel auth | Preview protection | Configure auth | ✅ Quick workaround |
