# Task ID: 24
# Title: Implement Two-Column Branded Demo Platform Layout
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 19, 21, 22, 23
# Priority: medium
# Description: Redesign the demo interface with a professional two-column layout featuring company branding in the left sidebar with logo and instructions, and an iPhone mockup display on the right side with clear SMS agent functionality explanation.
# Details:
1. Layout Structure Implementation:
   - Create a responsive two-column grid layout with appropriate breakpoints
   - Left column (sidebar): fixed width (25-30% on desktop) with company branding elements
   - Right column: flexible width (70-75% on desktop) containing the iPhone mockup
   - Implement collapsible sidebar for mobile views with toggle mechanism

2. Left Sidebar Development:
   - Design a clean, branded sidebar with consistent padding and spacing
   - Create a prominent area for company logo placement (supporting SVG and PNG formats)
   - Implement sections for:
     - Company name and tagline with appropriate typography
     - Demo explanation with concise, scannable text
     - User instructions with numbered or bulleted steps
     - "Act like a customer!" callout with visual emphasis (bold styling, accent color)
   - Add subtle background styling that aligns with company brand colors

3. Right Column Implementation:
   - Center the existing iPhone mockup (from Task #23) in this column
   - Ensure proper spacing around the device frame
   - Optimize the iPhone mockup scaling for different viewport sizes
   - Maintain the authentic iPhone UI styling from Task #22

4. Branding Integration:
   - Create a configuration system to dynamically inject company branding:
     - Company name variable for use throughout the interface
     - Color scheme variables that can be customized per client
     - Logo placement with appropriate fallbacks
   - Implement consistent typography that aligns with brand guidelines
   - Add subtle branded elements (patterns, colors) that don't overwhelm the interface

5. Instruction Content Development:
   - Write clear, concise instructions explaining:
     - How to interact with the demo ("Act like a customer!")
     - What the SMS agent functionality is and how it works
     - Expected response times and interaction patterns
   - Use appropriate visual hierarchy to make instructions scannable
   - Include small visual cues or icons to enhance understanding

6. Deployment Pipeline:
   - Set up a staging environment for testing the redesigned interface
   - Create a deployment checklist for production release
   - Implement a versioning system to track interface changes
   - Document the deployment process for future updates

# Test Strategy:
1. Visual Consistency Testing:
   - Verify the two-column layout renders correctly across all target devices and browsers
   - Confirm that the company branding elements (logo, colors, typography) display consistently
   - Test the responsive behavior at various breakpoints (desktop, tablet, mobile)
   - Validate that the iPhone mockup maintains its authentic appearance in the right column

2. Content and Instruction Validation:
   - Review all instructional content for clarity, grammar, and alignment with product messaging
   - Conduct user testing to ensure instructions are easily understood
   - Verify that the "Act like a customer!" callout is prominently displayed and noticeable
   - Confirm that the SMS agent functionality explanation is accurate and helpful

3. Branding Implementation Testing:
   - Test with multiple company profiles to ensure dynamic branding works correctly
   - Verify that company name appears consistently throughout the interface
   - Test logo display with various file formats and dimensions
   - Validate color scheme application across all interface elements

4. Responsive Design Testing:
   - Test the collapsible sidebar functionality on mobile devices
   - Verify that all content remains accessible and readable at all viewport sizes
   - Confirm that touch interactions work properly on mobile devices
   - Test landscape and portrait orientations on tablets and phones

5. Performance Testing:
   - Measure and optimize page load times with branding assets
   - Test rendering performance across different device capabilities
   - Verify that animations and transitions remain smooth on lower-end devices

6. Production Deployment Validation:
   - Perform a complete pre-launch checklist verification
   - Validate the production environment matches staging results
   - Conduct A/B comparison with the previous interface
   - Monitor initial user interactions and gather feedback
