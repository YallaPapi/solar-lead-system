# Solar Lead System - N8N Workflow Integration Fix

<context>
# Overview  
The Solar Lead System has an n8n workflow that automatically replies to interested leads with demonstration links. The system is failing at three critical points: emails sent via Instantly.ai are missing demo links, demo sites don't load when links are present, and AI chat functionality throws errors during interactions.

# Current System Analysis
- **N8N Workflow**: Processes webhooks, qualifies leads with AI, creates demos via API, sends emails via Instantly.ai
- **API Endpoints**: `/api/create-prototype` creates assistants, `/api/company-assistant` stores mappings, `/api/chat` handles conversations
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js 15.4.1, Vercel deployment, Upstash Redis, OpenAI Assistants API
- **Domain**: solarbookers.com with dynamic company slug URLs

# Core Issues  
- **Issue 1**: Instantly.ai emails missing demo links - field mapping mismatch between n8n payload and API expectations
- **Issue 2**: Demo sites failing to load - Redis lookup failures, assistant creation problems, or environment issues
- **Issue 3**: AI chat errors - OpenAI threading issues, timeout problems, or API integration failures

# User Experience Impact
- **Lead Response Flow**: Webhook → AI qualification → Demo creation → Email with link → Prospect clicks → Chat interface
- **Current Failure Points**: Links missing from emails, broken demo pages, non-functional chat
- **Business Impact**: Lost qualified leads, poor first impressions, reduced conversion rates

# Technical Architecture Fix Requirements
- **Field Mapping Alignment**: N8N workflow sends specific field names that must match API expectations exactly
- **URL Generation Consistency**: Demo URL generation must be identical between n8n provisional URLs and API-generated URLs  
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive debugging and error tracking for each integration point
- **Environment Validation**: Verify Redis connections, OpenAI API keys, and Vercel deployment configuration

# Development Roadmap  

## Phase 1: Analysis and Debugging Infrastructure
- Create comprehensive debug endpoint to test Redis, OpenAI, and environment configuration
- Build test suite page to validate each integration point independently
- Analyze n8n workflow JSON to understand exact data flow and field mappings
- Document current vs. expected behavior at each step

## Phase 2: Field Mapping and URL Generation Fixes
- Fix API endpoints to handle exact field names from n8n workflow payload
- Align slug generation algorithm between n8n and API to ensure URL consistency
- Update data parsing logic to handle n8n's location format and field structure
- Validate URL generation produces working demo links

## Phase 3: Redis and OpenAI Integration Stability
- Fix Redis connection and key storage/retrieval for company-assistant mappings
- Resolve OpenAI threading and timeout issues in chat API
- Improve error handling and retry logic for API failures
- Add comprehensive logging for debugging workflow failures

## Phase 4: End-to-End Testing and Validation
- Test complete workflow from n8n webhook to working chat interface
- Validate Instantly.ai email integration includes correct demo links
- Verify demo pages load correctly with proper assistant associations
- Confirm AI chat functionality works without errors

# Logical Dependency Chain
1. **Debug Infrastructure**: Must be able to diagnose issues before fixing them
2. **Field Mapping**: Core data flow must work before advanced features
3. **URL Generation**: Demo links must be valid before testing chat functionality  
4. **Redis/OpenAI Integration**: Data persistence and AI functionality must be stable
5. **End-to-End Validation**: Complete workflow testing to ensure all components work together

# Risks and Mitigations  
- **Environment Variables**: Missing or incorrect API keys could cause failures - validate all credentials
- **API Rate Limits**: OpenAI/Redis rate limits could cause intermittent failures - implement proper retry logic
- **Vercel Deployment**: Server/client-side rendering issues could affect functionality - test in production environment
- **N8N Workflow Changes**: Updates to workflow could break integration - maintain exact field mapping compatibility
